\newcommand{\pubabstract}{This document summarizes the development, organization, and contents of the NIST Cone Calorimetery Database. Since its development at NIST in 1982 (then the National Bureau of Standards, NBS), the cone calorimeter has enabled researchers to collect invaluable data for the characterization of material flammability behavior in response to well-characterized heating conditions. This project aims to create a digital repository of cone calorimetry data, organized with standard formatting and metadata to allow easy access to experimental measurements and derived properties (e.g., heat of combustion, ignition and fire growth parameters, and average burning rate in response to known heating conditions). Measurement data collected from 1983 to the present will be made available, including thousands of experiments on a wide range of materials including commodity plastics, woods, cables, vegetative fuels, and flooring and other building materials.}
