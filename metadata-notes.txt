"conditioning": NaN,
"conditioned?_{y/n}": "No",
"conditioning_temperature_c": NaN,
"conditioning_rh_%": NaN,
check to see if all FTT data for conditioning is blank - if so: this is not really relevant; if not: keep

"e_mj/kg": "13.1"
this is the value for oxygen, so some tests may have different values for this (e.g. more highly oxygenated ones, methane, etc.)

"substrate_used?_{y/n}": "No",
"substrate": "none"
substrate could be metal, insulation, etc. 

"edge_frame?": "Yes",
"surface_area_cm^2": "88.4",
The edge frame reduces the area of the sample from 100cm^2 to 88.4cm^2 on the FTT cone.
Could affect some calculations since those are based on area.

"comments": NaN,
"pre-test_comments": NaN,
"after-test_comments": NaN,
"events": NaN,
"number_of_events": "0"
like conditioning - check to see if these are always blank - if they are, delete; otherwise: keep
events could be things like start of dripping, photos, etc. (?)

"data_collected": NaN,
"co/co2_data_collected?": "Yes",
"mass_data_collected?": "Yes",
"smoke_data_collected?": "Yes",
"soot_mass_data_collected?": "No",
"soot_mass_ratio_1:x": NaN,
"soot_mass_g": NaN
check if always blank, discard if so
