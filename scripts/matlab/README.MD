## cone-db MATLAB Sripts

This folder holds a number of scripts to work with cone data.


Cone_Cfactor_Analysis.m can be used to review the history of C-factor calculations on an FTT cone. This script looks at all C-factor data found in [\\firedata\FLAMMABILITY_DATA\DATA\Cone\FTT-White\Calib] and will plot the time-history of C-factor vs. calibration number on a dual-y-axis plot. This allows you to look for trends in which of the 4 main signals affecting C factor may be affecting calculated value.

The second y-axis must be changed to plot either (1) pressure drop (2), Temperature in Exhaust Duct, (3) X_O2, or (4) Reported Methane HRR.
