The graph shows two data series plotted against time (in seconds) on the x-axis:

1. Sp Ext Area (m2/kg) - represented by the black line, scale on the left y-axis from 0 to 3000 m2/kg
2. Mass Dot (g/s-m2) - represented by the red line, scale on the right y-axis from 0 to 40 g/s-m2

The Sp Ext Area shows a general increasing trend over time, starting low and rising to around 650 m2/kg by the end of the test period.

The Mass Dot shows more variation, with several peaks and troughs. It starts high, reaches its maximum early in the test (around 20 g/s-m2), then generally decreases over time with some fluctuations. There's a notable spike near the 500-second mark.

The test appears to run for about 500 seconds (just over 8 minutes), though the x-axis extends to 1000 seconds.
